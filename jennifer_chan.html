    <h1>Hi, I'm Jenn.</h1>

    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>I studied environmental science and film at UCLA. 🌱🎬 Then I worked in digital marketing for five years at Disney where I leveraged social media and consumer insights to inform my content creation decisions.</p>

    <p>Currently, I'm pursing my master's in information management and systems at UC Berkeley where I'm repurposing my analytical skills and using user research to inform my UX design decisions.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of work, I love handlettering, binging podcasts, and reading sci-fi novels. 🖋🎧🪐</p>
